Real-Time Face Recognition Attendance System
This project is a comprehensive attendance system that uses real-time face recognition. It is built with Python using the Streamlit framework for the user interface and the powerful InsightFace library for state-of-the-art face detection and recognition.

Features
User-Friendly Web Interface: A clean and simple UI built with Streamlit.

Real-Time Face Detection: Captures and processes video streams from a webcam in real time.

Accurate Face Recognition: Uses the buffalo_l model from InsightFace for high-accuracy facial recognition.

User Registration: Easily register new users (e.g., Students, Teachers) by capturing their facial embeddings.

Automatic Attendance Logging: Detects known individuals and logs their attendance with a timestamp.

Flexible Database Support: Easily configurable to work with a local MongoDB or MySQL server.

Tech Stack
Backend: Python

Frontend: Streamlit

Face Recognition: InsightFace, OpenCV

Database: MongoDB / MySQL (configurable)

Libraries: Streamlit-Webrtc, Pandas, NumPy

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8+: Make sure you have Python installed.

MongoDB or MySQL: Install and run a local instance of your chosen database.

Install MongoDB Community Edition

[suspicious link removed]

2. Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>

3. Download the buffalo_l Model
The InsightFace buffalo_l model is required for face analysis. It is too large to be included in the repository.

Download Link: Download buffalo_l Model Files from Google Drive

Placement:

After downloading, you will have several model files (e.g., det_10g.onnx, w600k_r50.onnx, etc.).

In the root directory of the project, create a new folder named .insightface.

Inside .insightface, create another folder named models.

Inside models, create a final folder named buffalo_l.

Place all the downloaded model files inside this buffalo_l folder.

The final directory structure should look like this:

your-project-root/
├── .insightface/
│   └── models/
│       └── buffalo_l/
│           ├── 1k3d68.onnx
│           ├── 2d106det.onnx
│           ├── det_10g.onnx
│           ├── genderage.onnx
│           ├── r100-arcface-ms1m-refine-v2.onnx
│           └── w600k_r50.onnx
├── app.py
├── face_rec_merged.py
└── ... other files

4. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python libraries using the provided requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Configure the Database
Open the face_rec_merged.py file and update the database connection details to point to your local MongoDB or MySQL instance. (Instructions for this are in the code comments).

How to Run the Application
Open your terminal in the project's root directory.

Run the following command:

streamlit run app.py

The application will open in your web browser.

Application Workflow
Registration: Navigate to the "Registration" page from the sidebar. Enter the person's name and role, and look at the camera to collect face samples. Click "Submit" to save.

Attendance: Go to the "Attendance" page. The system will start the webcam and automatically detect registered individuals, logging their attendance every 30 seconds.

File Structure
app.py: The main Streamlit application file. It handles the UI and page navigation.

face_rec_merged.py: The backend logic for the application. It contains all the code for face detection, recognition, and database interactions.

requirements.txt: A list of all Python dependencies for the project.
